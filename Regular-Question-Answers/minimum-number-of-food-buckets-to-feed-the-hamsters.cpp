/*
 * The goal of this algorithm is to determine the minimum number of buckets required
 * to place hamsters in a line according to the given rules.
 *
 * The algorithm iterates through each character in the 'hamsters' string,
 * representing the arrangement of hamsters and empty spaces.
 *
 * Time complexity:O(n)
 * Space complexity:O(1)
