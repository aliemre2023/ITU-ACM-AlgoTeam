// Time Comlplexity: O(N)
// Space Complexity: O(logN) --> because of the stack memory used by the recursive function 'dfs'.
// The maximum number of times the function 'dfs' will be called is the depth of the tree.

// To add all values in range [low, high], we must iterate over the tree utilizing depth-first search (DFS).
