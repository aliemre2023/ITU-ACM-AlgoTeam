// Time Complexity: O(4^(m*n))
// Space Complexity: O(m*n)




// This solution explores all possible paths from the starting square to the ending square 
// and increments the result count whenever a valid path is found. 
// The DFS approach ensures that all paths are systematically explored.

// m and n represent the dimensions of the grid.
// eCount is used to keep track of the count of empty squares (squares with a value of 0) in the grid.
// res is the result variable that will store the number of unique paths.

// If an empty square was used, mark it as obstacles that we cannot walk over again.
//
