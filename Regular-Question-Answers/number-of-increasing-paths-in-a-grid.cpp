/**
 * In the question we are asked to find the number of increasing paths in a grid.
 * These paths can start and end at any cell in the grid.
 * So we need to find the number of increasing paths starting from each cell.
 * 
 * INTUITION:
 * First, our aim is to find sum of the all increasing paths starting from each cell.
 * We will do that by using DFS.
 * For example if we are at (i, j) cell and we can go to all of its neighbouring cells,
 * by only one condition: The next cell must be larger than the current cell.
 * And our result for the current cell will be the sum of the results of the next cells.
 * Because if I know the number of increasing paths starting from the next cell and the next cell is
 * larger than the current cell, That means there are "n" paths starting from the current cell.
 * (Assuming "n" is the number of paths starting from the next cell).
 * 
 * Once we understand the algorithms now we can implement it.
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION:
 * We will use DFS to find the number of increasing paths starting from each cell.
 * We will use Dynamic Programming to avoid overlapping subproblems.
 * We will use a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] is the number of increasing paths starting from (i, j).
 * Initially, all the values in dp will be -1. And we will fill it with the help of DFS.
 * And we will do modulus operation by the number '1e9+7' to avoid overflow.
