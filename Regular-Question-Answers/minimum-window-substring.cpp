// Time Complexity: O(n) size of string max(s, t)
// Space Complexity: O(n) number of unique letters in t

/*
 * The logic behind this solution is using a map to save the unique letters and their counts in t
 * Then by using sliding windows, finding the smallest window possible that matches string t
 *
 * First, we expand the window until it matches t,
 * Then we narrow it down until it doesn't match t,
 * While narrowing down, we save the narrowest matching window that matches t.
 *
 * In the end, narrowest window will be the answer, or an empty string if the narrowest window
 * size didn't update during our iteration.
