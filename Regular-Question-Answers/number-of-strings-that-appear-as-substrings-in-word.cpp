/*
 * The goal of this algorithm is to count the number of strings from the given vector
 * 'patterns' that appear as substrings in the input string 'word'.
 *
 * The algorithm iterates through each pattern in the 'patterns' vector and checks
 * if it is a substring of the input 'word' using the std::string::find() function.
 * If a pattern is found in 'word', the result counter is incremented.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n*m)
 * Memory complexity: O(1)

        int result = 0;
        // Number of patterns in the vector 'patterns'
        int n = patterns.size(); 

        // Iterate through each pattern
