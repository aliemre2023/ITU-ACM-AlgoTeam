/*
 * The question asks us to pass through the least number of obstacles and reach the end of the grid.
 * We can think of the grid as a graph and traverse the grid with DFS or BFS.
 * It may be a good method to use BFS and keep the number of obstacles required to reach that node for each node.
 * But the BFS traverse does not always guarantee us the lowest number of obstacles.
 * Can we create an algorithm that will give us the right result if we choose the node with
 * the lowest number of obstacles in each BFS iteration (similar to greedy algorithms)?
 *
 * Let's think about it: at any time T we choose the node with the lowest number of obstacles,
 * but a path with more obstacles at that time T will have fewer obstacles at the end of the algorithm.
 * Can we get the right result in this case? Actually... yes. Because at time T'>T,
 * the path we chose at time T will not have the lowest number of obstacles(otherwise that would be the answer :) )
 * and will fall back in the queue. So we can reach the correct result by updating the queue every iteration
 * and selecting the node with the least number of obstacles.
 *
 * To get a queue that will update itself every iteration, we can use our old friend priority queue.
 * Since we need to keep x and y values as well as the number of obstacles, we need to write a custom comparator.
 *
 * We need to update the queue every iteration, so the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(m*n*log(m*n))
 * where m*n is the size of the grid.
